**HuskChat** is a no-frills, simple and customisable chat system for Minecraft networks. It supports both running on BungeeCord and Velocity frontend servers for cross-server chat, or on a single-server Spigot setup.

It's designed to be easy to configure with an elegant out-of-box setup, while also being highly configurable, suiting a variety of use cases by allowing you to define channels and manage who can send and receive messages within them.

## Features

**⭐ Private messaging** &mdash; Private messages&mdash;including group DMs&mdash and replying, admin spy features

**⭐ Fine-tune channels** &mdash; Set send/receive permissions for channels, send messages to a discord webhook, filter [& more](https://william278.net/docs/huskchat/channels)!

**⭐ Quick and easy to use** &mdash; Super simple set of [commands](https://william278.net/docs/huskchat/commands). Define channel shortcut commands, too!

**⭐ Advanced profanity checking** &mdash; Machine learning powered profanity filter
