HuskChat provides `/socialspy` and `/localspy` commands. Players with permission can toggle `socialspy` to see the
private messages of users. 

On servers running HuskChat on proxy-server setups, the `/localspy` command is also available. This allows players with permission to view messages sent in Local chat channels on other servers, including ones that passthrough messages locally.

## Bypassing Social Spy
If you have the `huskchat.command.socialspy.bypass` permission, you can bypass having your messages be spied on. Note though that other players with the `huskchat.command.socialspy.bypass` permission bypass the bypass and will be able to see your private messages.
