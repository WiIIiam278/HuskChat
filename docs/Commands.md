## Channel send and receive permissions
Channels also have their own permission to send and receive to.

You can configure these in the channel config file, but by default they are `huskchat.channel.<channel>.receive`. Channels without permissions set do not require the permission node to talk in.

## Chat formatting permissions
Formatting messages also has its own permission to allow users to use minedown. 

You can apply the node, `huskchat.formatted_chat`, to allow players to format there messages with any Minedown formatting. Any users attempting to use formatting without the node will simply send the format in chat as a normal message, having the format in the configuration file be used instead.
